                        My name is Jonathan Echevarria Davila and I am an IT/Full Stack Developer. I work as an IT
                        Support
                        Engineer for a
                        company called REPAY.
                        I am currently developing my skills as a web developer in the 6 month coding
                        bootcamp at Georgia Tech.
                        <br>
                        I was born and raised in the beautiful island of Puerto Rico. I love going to the beach and
                        surfing. My
                        favorite place in the world is Flamenco beach.
                        I like doing sports, exercise and cook all kinds of food. I studied culinary arts but only use
                        the skills I
                        learned to cook for my family and friends.
                        <br>
                        As a child I was always interested in building stuff. I was introduced to the world of
                        technology when my
                        Army recruiter recommended me
                        the IT job in the Army. Since day one of school I realized I had found what I wanted to do for
                        the rest of
                        my life. After I got out I wanted more, I wanted to
                        start building because that's what I'm meant to do after all. I decided to become a developer so
                        I can build
                        great things and help people in any way I can.
